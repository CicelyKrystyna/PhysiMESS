### Key makefile rules:

**`make`**: compiles the current project. If no 
                     project has been defined, it first 
                     populates the cancer heterogeneity 2D 
                     sample project and compiles it 
   
**`make project-name`**: populates the indicated sample project. 
                     Use "make" to compile it. 

   * **`project-name`** choices:
      * template 
      * biorobots-sample 
      * cancer-biorobots-sample 
      * cancer-immune-sample
      * celltypes3-sample 
      * heterogeneity-sample 
      * pred-prey-farmer 
      * virus-macrophage-sample 
      * worm-sample
      * ode-energy-sample 
      * physiboss-cell-lines-sample 
      * cancer-metabolism-sample
      * interaction-sample
      * mechano-sample

**`make list-projects`** : list all available sample projects 

**`make clean`**         : removes all .o files and the executable, so that the next "make" recompiles the entire project 

**`make data-cleanup`**  : clears out all simulation data 

**`make reset`**         : de-populates the sample project and returns to the original PhysiCell state. Use this when switching to a new PhysiCell sample project. 

**`make jpeg`**          : uses ImageMagick to convert the SVG files in the output directory to JPG (with appropriate sizing to make movies). Supply `OUTPUT=foldername` to select a different folder. 

**`make movie`**         : uses ffmpeg to convert the JPG files in the output directory an mp4 movie. Supply `OUTPUT=foldername` to select a different folder, or `FRAMERATE=framerate` to override the frame rate.

**`make upgrade`**       : fetch the latest release of PhysiCell and overwrite the core library and sample projects.

## Release summary: 
Version 1.11.0 adds several notable features, fixes bugs, and further expands the "signals" and "behaviors" that can be read and written with a simple API to facilitate building models. In particular, we add a brand new CSV format for initial cell positions (with more robust naming of cells by their human-readable names, a "header" line, and ability to extensively add and specificy individual cell properties), a new ability to save and load user projects in the `user_projects` directory, automated dynamic formation and breakage of spring-based cell-cell adhesions (based upon the cell-cell adhesion affinities, attachment rates, and detachment rates), automated inclusion of spring-based adhesions (at the mechanics time step) without need for the user to explicitly supply a spring function, a new "mechano" sample project to illustrate the new automated spring functionality, and updates to PhysiBoSS to ensure compatibility with the rapidly improving PhysiCell Studio. In addition, there is new capability of adding a background coloring (e.g., an oxygen heatmap) to SVG ouptuts--see the `interaction-sample` for an illustration (use the alternate XML config file to enable). This release includes several bugfixes, the most critical of which is to update the parameters for necrotic cells (which had previously been misset in the XML files, thus disabling necrotic cell lysis and shrinking). 

**NOTE 1:** MacOS users need to define a PHYSICELL_CPP environment variable to specify their OpenMP-enabled g++. See the [Quickstart](documentation/Quickstart.md) for details.

**NOTE 2:** Windows users need to follow an updated (from v1.8) MinGW64 installation procedure. This will install an updated version of g++, plus libraries that are needed for some of the intracellular models. See the [Quickstart](documentation/Quickstart.md) for details.
 
### Major new features and changes in the 1.11.z versions
#### 1.11.0
+ New and improved (v2) cell CSV format for cell import. This allows more intuitive statement of initial cell positions. The first line of your CSV file must be: 

   ```x,y,z,cell type```

  Every subsequent line is a single cell, now referencing cell types by their human-readable names (as defined in your XML configuration file) rather than requiring the integer `ID`. So, a sample second line to place a CD8 T cell at (30,-10,12) would be: 

   ```30,-10,12,CD8 T cell```

  Moreover, the new format allows you to initialize a variety of individual cell properties, including (total) `volume` and any supported cell beheavior. For example, if your cell definitions have custom variables `GFP` ond `oncoprotein`, then you can extend the first header line to: 

  ```x,y,z,cell type,custom:GFP,custom:oncoprotein```

  And then subsequent cells look like this: 

    ```30,-10,12,CD8 T cell,0.5,3.2```
 
  You can tell our parser to skip specifying a specific variable with `s` or `S` or an empty entry. Here, the first cell would skip writing the initial value of the GFP, and teh second would skip initializing the oncoprotein: 

    ```30,-10,12,CD8 T cell,,3.2```  
    ```50,13,-4,M0 Macrophage,0.5,s```

  We will continue to automatically support older CSV cell files; any cells CSV file missing the first line of headers will be processed in the old format.  

+ Ability to save and load user projects
   + Use `make save PROJ=project_name` to save your project to a folder in `./user_projects` named `project_name`. For example: 

       ```make save PROJ=new_tumor_sample```

     saves your project as `new_tumor_sample`. In particular, it saves your `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, everything in `./config`, and everything in `./custom_modules`. 

   + Use `make load PROJ=project_name` to load your project from a folder in `./user_projects` named `project_name`. For example: 

        ```make load PROJ=new_tumor_sample```

     loads your project from `new_tumor_sample`. In particular, it loads your `Makefile`, `main.cpp`, everything in `./config`, and everything in `./custom_modules`. 
     
+ Extended `cell_interactions` to include a vector `immunogenicities`: for a cell, `immunogenicity[j]` is how immunogenic this cell is to the jth cell type. By default, these will all be set to 1. (See next point.) 

+ Updated the built-in "attack" model: 
  $$\textrm{Probability cell } i \textrm{ attacks cell } j \textrm{ in } [t,t+\Delta t] = \textrm{attack}\_{ij} \cdot \textrm{immunogenicity}\_{ji} \Delta t $$ 
  By setting $\textrm{immunogenicity}\_{ji} = 1$ as teh default value, we maintain compatibiltiy with prior models. This is a way to further modulate immunogenic and cytotoxic interactions. 

+ Began migrating built-in sample projects to be compatible with the model builder GUI and the upcoming PhysiCell Studio, including: 
  + template
  + biorobots (updates spring constant from 0.05 to 0.5)
  + heterogeneity
  + cancer biorobots (updates spring constant from 0.05 to 0.5)

+ Added new signals: 
  + `apoptotic` returns 1 if a cell is apoptotic, and 0 otherwise 
  + `necrotic` returns 1 if a cell is necrotic, and 0 otherwise 

  As always, access these via `double get_single_signal(Cell* pCell,std::string sig_name)`. 

+ Added new behaviors: 
  + `immunogenicity to [cell type]` is the cell's immunogenicity to a specific cell type. The probability that cell `i` attacks cell `j` in $[t,t+\Delta t]$ is $\textrm{attack}\_{ij} \cdot \textrm{immunogenicity}\_{ji} \Delta t.$
  + `cell attachment rate` is the rate at which the cell forms spring links with other cells. 
  + `cell detachment rate` is the rate at which spring links break. 
  + `maximum number of cell attachments` is the maximum number of spring links. 
  + `is_movable` can be set to 0 (false) to make an agent rigid: it will exert forces on other cells, but it itself cannot be moved. This behavior right now is somewhat fragile if used dynmaically, but can reliably be used during tissue setup. 

  As always, access these via `double get_single_behavior(Cell* pCell,std::string beh_name)` and `void set_single_behavior(Cell* pCell,std::string beh_name,double new_value)`.

+ Added new standard model `void dynamic_attachments(Cell*, Phenotype& ,double);` This function can automate dynamic attachments and detachments. When calling this function for cell $i$: 
  + For each current attachment, it detaches with probability $\textrm{detachment rate}\_i \Delta t$ 
  + For each cell $j$ in the neighbors list, it forms an attachment with probability 
  
    $$\textrm{Prob attach } i \textrm{ to cell } j = \textrm{adhesion affinity}\_j \cdot \textrm{attachment rate}\_i \cdot \Delta t.$$
    
    The attachment is only formed if both cell $i$ and $j$ have not exceeded their maximum number of 
    attachments. 

+ Added a new `spring_attachments` (of type `std::vector<Cell*>`) to cell `state` to track automated formation and removal of spring-link adhesions separately of the user-focused `attached` data struture. This will allow users to continue managing the `attachments` structure on their own for custom contact functions, without interference from automated springs (see more below).

+ Added new standard model `void dynamic_spring_attachments(Cell*, Phenotype& ,double);` This functions exactly as the `dynamic_attachments` function, except it stores attached cells to `cell.state.spring_attachments` to avoid interfering with the user-managed `cell.state.attachments` data struture. 

+ **Automated spring attachments / detachments:** the new `dynamic_spring_attachments` function is automatically called at every mechancis time step, with cell-cell spring attachment and detachment based on the cells' current rates. Each cell evaluates spring-like elastic adhesion betwen itslef and cells in `cell.state.spring_attachments` to add to its own velocity. Some notes: 
  + Each cell automatically removes all its spring attachments during division 
  + Each cell automatically removes all its spring attachments at the *end* of death. If you want dead cells to have increased detachment, add a rule accordingly using the built-in behavior dictionary. 
  + If a cell is not movable (`is_movable = false`), then it is not moved by springs, but it can exert spring forces on other cells, allowing it to act as an "anchor". 
  + This automated spring functionality is completely independent of (and does not interfere with) the user-defined contact function and user-manageed `cell.state.attached` data structure. 
  + **WARNING:** If in a past life you set `phenotype.mechanics.attachment_rate` to a nonzero rate, you may find yourself surprised with unintended spring adhesions as this new automation kicks in. Please review and revise your configuration file as necessary. 
  + You can disable this behavior in the XML configuration file: 
  ```
      <options>
          <!-- other options -->
          <disable_automated_spring_adhesions>true</disable_automated_spring_adhesions>
      </options>

+ Added a new `mechano-sample` project that shows automated dynamic attachment and detachment of cells: 
  + Constant cancer cell birth and death
  + Basic mechano feedback: high-pressure sets cancer cell birth to zero
  + Cancer cell phenotype sets high detachment rate upon death. 
  + Automated connection of cancer, basement membrane (BM) agents with spring links using the built-ins noted above. No user intervention or code required beyond setting nonzero rates. 
  + Cancer cells manually set to apoptose at 10000 min. 

+ Updated PhysiBoSS to remove cell definition "inheritance," (with "flat", self-standing cell definitions), to make it compatible with PhysiCell Studio. Hereafter, all properties of each cell definition must be explicitely defined. 

### Minor new features and changes: 
#### 1.11.0
+ Updated the `paint_by_number_cell_coloring` coloring function to paint the entire cell white if apoptotic, and brown if necrotic. (Previously, we colored the nucleus based on live/dead status.) This improves compatibility with the model GUI. 

+ Changed the default value of `attachment_rate` from 10 to 0 (in the `Mechanics` class) to avoid unexpected triggering of automated spring adheions. 

+ Added a safety check to `operator[]` for Parameters, based on [PR145](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/pull/145/). Thanks, Vincent Noel!! 

+ In PhysiBoSS, introduced a new state inheritance mechanism (global, and node-specific). 

+ PhisBoSS has a new optional start time, to initiate the intracellular model at t > 0.

+ Updated PhysiBoSS Cell Lines sample project (flatten XML, initial positions as CSV).

+ Started combining change log into a more compact format: Each release family (1.y.z, such as 1.10.z) receives an extended entry with new changes grouped by minor release. This allows major releases to be grouped with subsequent minor feature enhancements and bug fixes, for a much shorter change log that's easier to read. README will document all changes of the current release family. 

### Beta features (not fully supported):
#### 1.11.0
+ Added `bool read_microenvironment_from_matlab( std::string mat_filename )` to `BioFVM_MultiCellDS`. This will read and overwrite from a stored microenvironment (in `mat_filename`, saved as a level 4 Matlab file) if it has the following format: 
  + Number of columns = number of voxels (must match the size as configured in the `PhysiCell_settings.xml` file)
  + Number of rows = 3 + 1 + number of diffusing substrates (must match the size and ordering as configured in the `PhysiCell_settings.xml` file)
  + Row 0: x coordinate of each voxel
  + Row 1: y coordinate of each voxel 
  + Row 2: z coordinate of each voxel
  + Row 3: volume of each voxel 
  + Rows j to end: value of (j-4)th substrate in each voxel 
  + Column ordering: 
    * For each z from low to high:
      * For each y from low to high: 
        * for each x from low to high: 
          store voxel X[i] , Y[j], Z[k]. 
  + **Note:** This matches how PhysiCell saves the microenvironment. This will read any PhysiCell-saved microenvironment, so long as its sizes matches your current settings.  
  + **Note:** This may be fragile. It has only minimal error-checking. 

  + Set default cell attachment rate to 0 in the template project and most sample projects to avoid unexpectedly triggering the new autmoated spring adhesions; users must affirmatively set a nonzero attachment rate to trigger this new automation in an individual cell. 

  + In repsonse to [PR 123](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/pull/123), `parameters.TYPE.find_index(search_name)` now returns -1 if the searched term isn't found. Thanks, Daniel Bergman! 
 
### Bugfixes: 

#### 1.11.0
+ Fixed bug in cancer biorobots project that mistakenly set max cancer cell proliferation rate to 0.000072 instead of 0.00072

+ Fixed multiple broken signals/behaviors. 

+ Fixed calcification bug reported in issue [133](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/issues/133). Thank you, @JulianoGianlupi! 

+ Fixed typo in cell signals that used `contact with dead dell` instead of `contact with dead cell`

+ Changed default full data output to 60 minutes (to match the SVG output interval) for better compatibility with the model builder GUI. 

+ Fixed incorrect parameters for necrotic cell volume changes that prevented necrotic cell lysis and shrinkage. 

+ Merged Daniel Bergman's [PR 126](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/pull/126), which fixes cell legend colors. Thank's Daniel! 

+ Improved safety checks in the cell orientation function, thanks to Randy Heiland's [PR 122](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/pull/122). Thanks, Randy!

+ Now forcing Mersenne Twister as random generator in PhysiBoSS (use or /dev/random by MaBoSS would max out system descriptor)

+ MaBoSS BND/CFG parsing is now in an OpenMP critical block (flex/bison parser is not thread safe)

+ Remove duplicate initialization of maximum attachment rate from the Phenotype.Mechanics constructor.

+ Fixed bug in neighbor/attached graph output filenames (previously double-appended a suffix to the filenames). 

### Notices for intended changes that may affect backwards compatibility:
+ We intend to deprecate the unused phenotype variables `relative_maximum_attachment_distance`, `relative_detachment_distance`, and `maximum_attachment_rate` from `phenotype.mechanics.` 

+ We intend to merge `Custom_Variable` and `Custom_Vector_Variable` in the future.  

+ We may change the role of `operator()` and `operator[]` in `Custom_Variable` to more closely mirror the functionality in `Parameters<T>`. 

+ Additional search functions (e.g., to find a substrate or a custom variable) will start to return -1 if no matches are found, rather than 0. 
 
+ We will change the timing of when `entry_function`s are executed within cycle models. Right now, they are evaluated immediately after the exit from the preceding phase (and prior to any cell division events), which means that only the parent cell executes it, rather than both daughter cells. Instead, we'll add an internal Boolean for "just exited a phase", and use this to execute the entry function at the next cycle call. This should make daughter cells independently execute the entry function. 

+ We might make `trigger_death` clear out all the cell's functions, or at least add an option to do this. 

### Planned future improvements: 

+ Further XML-based simulation setup. 

+ Read saved simulation states (as MultiCellDS digital snapshots)
 
+ Add a new standard phenotype function that uses mechanobiology, where high pressure can arrest cycle progression. (See https://twitter.com/MathCancer/status/1022555441518338048.) 
 
+ Add module for standardized pharmacodynamics, as prototyped in the nanobio project. (See https://nanohub.org/resources/pc4nanobio.) 
 
+ Create an angiogenesis sample project 
 
+ Create a small library of angiogenesis and vascularization codes as an optional standard module in ./modules (but not as a core component)

+ Improved plotting options in SVG 

+ Further update sample projects to make use of more efficient interaction testing available

+ Major refresh of documentation.
