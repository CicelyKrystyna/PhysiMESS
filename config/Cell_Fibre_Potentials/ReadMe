In order to run different examples for this part you need to enter and change parts of the PhysiMESS code. Specifically, you need to comment/uncomment lines in the function add_potentials in PhysiCell_cell.cpp.

Fibre tracking Example
===============================================================================================
For this example we observe cells tracking along fibres 
- Fibre Degradation switched off
- In the second add_potentials if loop between a cell and a fibre
- Everything in the third add_potentials if loop between a fibre and a cell is commented
- You can play about with the adhesion and repulsion strengths in the xml:
  <vel_adhesion>0.6</vel_adhesion>
  <vel_contact>0.001</vel_contact>
  <cell_velocity_max>1.0</cell_velocity_max>

Snow Plough Example
===============================================================================================
For this example we observe cells pushing fibres providing those fibres have no cross-links
- Fibre Degradation switched off
- In the third add_potentials if loop between a fibre and a cell
- The following should be uncommented and ensure crosslink count set to >=1
  if (!other_agent->phenotype.motility.is_motile || this->parameters.X_crosslink_count >= 1) 
  { return;}
- uncomment between 
  /* for snow plough example uncomment from here: */ 
  and 
  /* for snow plough example uncomment to here: */

===============================================================================================
Hinge Example
===============================================================================================
For this example we observe cells both snow ploughing non-crosslinks fibres but also rotating 
singularly crosslinked fibres at a hinge. Note that this is the very early stages of implementing the Physics so it's beyond basic. Indeed the rotation currently has nothing to do with physics.
- Fibre Degradation switched off
- In the third add_potentials if loop between a fibre and a cell
- The following should be uncommented and ensure crosslink count set to >=2
  if (!other_agent->phenotype.motility.is_motile || this->parameters.X_crosslink_count >= 2) 
  { return;}
- uncomment both between 
  /* for snow plough example uncomment from here: */ 
  and 
  /* for snow plough example uncomment to here: */
  and 
  /* for hinge example uncomment from here: */ 
  and 
  /* for hinge example uncomment to here: */
