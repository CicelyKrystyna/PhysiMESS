In order to run different examples for this part you need to enter and change parts of the PhysiMESS code. Specifically, you need to comment/uncomment lines in the function add_potentials in PhysiCell_cell.cpp.

Fibre tracking Example
===============================================================================================
For this example we observe cells tracking along fibres 
- Fibre Degradation switched off
- Fibre Pushing switched off
- Fibre Rotation switched off 
- Found in the second add_potentials if loop between a cell and a fibre
- You can play about with the adhesion and repulsion strengths in the xml:
  <vel_adhesion>0.6</vel_adhesion>
  <vel_contact>0.001</vel_contact>
  <cell_velocity_max>1.0</cell_velocity_max>

Snow Plough Example
===============================================================================================
For this example we observe cells pushing fibres providing those fibres have no cross-links
- Fibre Degradation switched off
- Fibre Pushing switched on
- Fibre Rotation switched off 
- Found in the third add_potentials if loop between a fibre and a cell

===============================================================================================
Hinge Example
===============================================================================================
For this example we observe cells both freely rotate non-crosslinked fibres about their centre but also rotating singularly crosslinked fibres at a hinge (the crosslink point). 
- Fibre Degradation switched off
- Fibre Pushing switched off
- Fibre Rotation switched on
- Found in the third add_potentials if loop between a fibre and a cell
- You can play about with the stickiness of fibres in the xml (one being free movement):
  <fibre_sticky>1.0</fibre_sticky>
